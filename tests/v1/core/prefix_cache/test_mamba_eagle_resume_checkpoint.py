"""Mamba "align" check-points at the position an EAGLE sibling resumes from.

Full attention hits where it holds a key; EAGLE prunes one hash unit off that
candidate and drops it. Mamba materializes state only on its own block grid, so
the pruned position holds nothing and the hit floors back a whole Mamba block.

Gated by ``CacheConfig.enable_mamba_fine_grained_prefix_cache``. Every test here
drives the real ``Scheduler._mamba_block_aligned_split`` and the real
``KVCacheManager``; no chunk boundary is hard-coded.
